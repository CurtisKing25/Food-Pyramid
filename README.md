# Food-Pyramid
•This is a Food Pyramid website that I created for my Web Information Processing Module.  
•It has two versions, one which is a basic food Pyramid with a date.  
•The other has an under 5 or over 5 option which highlights when the user goes over the recommended amount for each layer of the Pyramid.  
•The layers also grow is size as you increment them and decrease is size as you decrement them.
